## General Information

This project aims to reinforce knowledge of HTML form elements. These include elements such as `<button>`, `<label>`, and `<input>`. This knowledge primarily comes from The Odin Project (see Acknowledgements) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms).

Furthermore, this project is my first project that I am writing using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). In turn, it is also the first one that I am using all of the many plug-ins that I picked out while configuring Vim. Most notable additions include [Emmet-vim](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim) and [Lazygit](https://github.com/kdheepak/lazygit.nvim) as well as their parent projects.
